                <p>Kairos is a Java program aimed to create and optimize school timetables. Its main features, among other, are:

                <ul>
                    <li>Teachers, classrooms, courses, and restrictions are part of the model.</li>
                    <li>It uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to look for a possible solution of the model.</li>
                    <li>From a solution computed by the GA (which may be or not optimal), user can visually rearrange
                        timetable items, recalculating automatically restrictions.</li>
                    <li>In the timetable window, items that don't verify a restriction are marked as red.</li>
                    <li>Currently, it implements the following restrictions:
                        <ul>
<!--                            <li>Groups not ubicuous</li>
                            <li>Teachers not ubicuous</li>-->
                            <li>Courses cannot have gaps between.</li>
                            <li>A teacher cannot/only can teach some days in some hours.</li>
                            <li>Teachers cannot exceed a maximum of hours each day</li>
                            <li>A teeacher cannot spread its courses in more than a give number of days</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>It is relatively easy to implement custom-made restrictions.</li>
                    <li>It should run without problems in any Java-capable OS (currently tested on Windows XP, Windows 7, Linux)</li>
                    <li>It is free software, licensed by the GNU Public License.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Limitations</h3>
                Kairos is currently under development. Although a full usable version is avalaible, there are still some features missing:
                <ul>
                    <li>Assignation of courses to clasrooms are static, that is, are given by the user at design time.
                        So, it cannot be used for example when different groups have to share a
                        common classroom as for example, a computer room.</li>
                    <li>Currently, Kairos doesn't support subgroups division such that a subgroup can be in a course
                        while another subgroup is in another differente course. </li>
                    <li>Right now, the program is entirely in spanish, but I am currently doing the traslation to English.</li>
                </ul>
